# BookRecWebApp
## https://heroku-book-app.herokuapp.com
repo for book recommendation book app. Book embeddings are trained using contrastive learning with data from good reads dataset, language model trained using synthetic queries from tags user had given to books.

More a proof of concept for idea. Book embeddings could be improved with a better sampling scheme + hyper_param tuning as well as a better context generation scheme (GNNs could be something). Query embeddings could also be tuned a bit better... Variable length synthetic queries, hierarchical softmax, the list goes on!
